# üìï OmniFocus Logbook for Obsidian

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) will periodically sync your [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) completed and dropped actions with your Obsidian Daily Notes.

## Why?

I love using OmniFocus for task management. But I also want Obsidian daily notes to be a holistic view of my day-to-day. This plugin dumps completed and dropped actions from OmniFocus into my daily notes, meaning I can keep my same workflow, and my Second Brain has a new data source.

## Disclaimer üö®

The initial sync will backfill your entire OmniFocus history of completed and dropped actions into Obsidian. This potentially means creating/modifying hundreds of files. I recommend testing this plugin out in a new vault first to make sure you're happy with the result.

### Backup your data

While I have tested this plugin with my own data, your mileage may vary. I am not at fault for any data loss that may incur. Backup your data!

## Usage

This plugin fetches all your completed and dropped actions from OmniFocus and adds them to the Daily Note corresponding to the **completion date** of the action.

Actions are grouped by their folder in OmniFocus. The plugin displays:
- Completed actions (marked with `[x]`)
- Dropped actions (marked with `[c]` by default, configurable)
- Any subtasks/checklist items
- Tags associated with the actions
- Notes attached to actions (optional)

Each action is formatted as a markdown link that opens the action in OmniFocus when clicked.

### Example Output

```markdown
### Completed Tasks

#### Work

- [x] [Complete project proposal](omnifocus:///task-id-here) #logbook/work
    Project notes and details
- [c] [Deprecated feature request](omnifocus:///task-id-here) #logbook/work

#### Personal

- [x] [Buy groceries](omnifocus:///task-id-here) #logbook/personal
```
